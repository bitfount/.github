### **Hi, we're Bitfount** 👋

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that's easy to describe but hard to solve: *The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.* Increasing regulations and the limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what *should* be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way.

**Bitfount’s goal is to make the world’s intractable data *interactable*.‍**

To do that, we’re building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network for sending algorithms to data instead of the other way around. We enable organisations to easily share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising on privacy, and without needing to share any raw data.

### 🚀 A secure, flexible, easy-to-install platform

Our product combines the best of SaaS platforms, open source developer tools, and powerful AI/ML and analysis frameworks. None of the usual headaches associated with setting up decentralised consortia.

### ❤️ Loved by Information Governance teams

Eliminate unnecessary sharing of raw data while maintaining full permission control and audit logs of any processing carried out. Our architecture keeps all data behind the firewall **and** doesn’t require you to punch any holes through it for incoming connections.

### 🛠️ An open source library and community

Use any of our built-in protocols, algorithms and models, create your own, or use one created by the Bitfount community, all while being fully compatible with Bitfount’s user-friendly, granular, RBAC-based governance system.
